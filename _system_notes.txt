On your server, use wget and paste the link that you copied in order to download the archive file:

wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.30/node-v0.10.30.tar.gz

Extract the archive and move into the new directory by typing:

tar xzvf node-v* && cd node-v*
There are a few packages that we need to download from the CentOS repositories in order to compile the code. Use yum to get these now:

sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++
Now, we can configure and compile the software:

./configure
make
The compilation will take quite awhile. When it is finished, you can install the software onto your system by typing:

sudo make install
To check that the installation was successful, you can ask Node to display its version number:

node --version
v0.10.30
If you see the version number, then the installation was completed successfully.


// once we've installed node, we'll need to install grub from the node package manager.
// This will install grunt globally if it doens't exist.

npm install -g grunt-cli

// Now that we have installed grunt, we can run it on any existing project build.

// If we don't have a project, we can initialize it with the following which will create the package.json file.

cd /project/path
npm init

// Now that we've initialized it, we can install grunt into the project so that anyone can just re-run it. 

cd /project/path
npm install
 ,y
npm install grunt --save-dev

// The above will create directories for node and it's modules.

// Grunt is now going to run, however we still need to create the grunt file. 

// Make a js file called Gruntfile.js inside the root of the project.

// Now we can create/intall dependencies. This should also be included inside the project folder.

// Below are some to use for most projects.

npm install grunt-contrib-compass --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-sass --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-cssmin --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-concat --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-jshint --save-dev
npm install matchdep --save


// NOTE:
// for this particular package you need ruby & sass installed. 
yum install rubygems
// now that ruby is installed
gem install sass

// This project also depends on matchdep, npm install matchdep --save
