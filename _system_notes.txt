// once we've installed node, we'll need to install grub from the node package manager.
// This will install grunt globally if it doens't exist.
npm install -g grunt-cli
// Now that we have installed grunt, we can run it on any existing project build.

// If we don't have a project, we can initialize it with the following which will create the package.json file.

cd /project/path
npm init

// Now that we've initialized it, we can install grunt into the project so that anyone can just re-run it. 

cd /project/path
npm install grunt --save-dev

// The above will create directories for node and it's modules.

// Grunt is now going to run, however we still need to create the grunt file. 

// Make a js file called Gruntfile.js inside the root of the project.

// Now we can create/intall dependencies. This should also be included inside the project folder.

// Below are some to use for most projects.

npm install grunt-contrib-compass --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-sass --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-cssmin --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-concat --save-dev
npm install grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev


// NOTE:
// for this particular package you need ruby & sass installed. 
yum install rubygems
// now that ruby is installed
gem install sass
